I have been looking at the following hosting options:

Heroku - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-java
AWS EB with Corretto JDK - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/
Docker (Docker host TBA) - https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
I'll come back to this later. Hosting is a lower priority.
