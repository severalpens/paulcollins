I continued the https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/ tutorial.  This was compiling and running correctly out of VS Code.

I also tried to run the AWS Corretto example but this no longer working. The first error is 'The import javax.servlet.http cannot be resolved'. I'm currently googling it. 

I would prefer to keep AWS as the host so I'd like to merge the two projects once I figure out how dependencies are handled. It seems a lot more complex than package management in .Net or Node.js.
